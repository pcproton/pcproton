    <h2>Who We Are</h2>
    <p>Pcproton focuses on delivering reliable and affordable PC builds designed for performance on a budget. We understand that not everyone wants to spend hundreds or thousands just to get a smooth gaming or work experience.</p>

    <h2>Our Mission</h2>
    <p>Our aim is simple: provide high‑quality, well‑tested budget builds that offer the best value for your money. Every build is tailored to offer strong performance without unnecessary extras.</p>

    <h2>Why Choose Us?</h2>
    <p>We specialise in low‑cost parts that still deliver excellent results. Whether you're a gamer, student, or content creator, we build systems that perform well without breaking the bank.</p>
      <h2>What Makes Us Different</h2>
    <p>Many PC building companies focus on quick sales, upselling expensive parts, or offering little to no customer support once the purchase is complete. Customers are often left with unanswered questions, confusing issues, and no clear guidance.</p>

    <p>At Pcproton, we take pride in doing the opposite. We put our customers first. Whether you need help choosing components, troubleshooting a problem, or getting honest advice, we’re here every step of the way. Our commitment to support and transparency is what sets us apart.</p>
